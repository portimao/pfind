# pfind

As I started to learn Python I want to do something practical and simple. 
I choosed to implement file search in Python.

So my program should take search string as parameter, optional parameter SEARCH_DIR and make recursive search in it.

Roadmap: 
1. Just a simple find search string in file or directory name
2. Search in files
3. Multithreading
